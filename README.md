# Digital Image Processing

## 📌 1. Digital Image Basics
- A digital image is a **2D matrix of intensity values** (grayscale or color).
- Represented as `I(u, v)` where `u, v` are integer coordinates.
- Common formats: 
  - Grayscale (1 value per pixel)
  - RGB (3 values per pixel)
  - RGBA (4 values per pixel, includes alpha/opacity)

## 📸 2. Types of Digital Images
Examples include:
- Natural landscapes, synthetic scenes, posters, screenshots
- Medical: X-rays, microscope slides
- Scientific: Satellite, radar, astronomical images
- Biometric: Fingerprints, barcodes

## 🛠️ 3. Image Processing Overview
- Input: image → Processing algorithm → Output: modified image
- Goals:
  - Enhance human interpretation
  - Improve display/printing
  - Edit, enhance, compress images

## 🔧 4. Common Image Processing Operations
- **Noise Removal**: Reduce random or structured noise
- **Contrast Adjustment**: Improve visibility
- **Edge Detection**: Identify object boundaries
- **Segmentation**: Divide image into regions
- **Compression**: Reduce file size (e.g., JPEG)
- **Inpainting**: Restore damaged parts

## 🧠 5. Applications
- **Medicine**: MRI, X-ray analysis
- **Astronomy**: Image enhancement of celestial objects
- **Security**: Face recognition, fingerprint analysis
- **GIS**: Terrain classification, weather forecasting
- **HCI**: Gesture and face recognition

## 🔄 6. Key Stages in Digital Image Processing
1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture image via sensor/camera
2. **Enhancement**: Improve contrast, brightness
3. **Restoration**: Remove noise, correct distortions
4. **Segmentation**: Partition image into regions
5. **Object Recognition**: Identify and label objects
6. **Representation & Description**: Convert regions into usable data
7. **Compression**: Reduce storage needs

## 📐 7. Mathematical Foundations
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability & Statistics
- Differential Equations
- Differential Geometry
- Harmonic Analysis (Fourier, wavelet transforms)

## 🔗 Relationship with Other Fields
- **Low-level**: Image analysis (segmentation, registration)
- **Mid-level**: Image processing (enhancement, compression)
- **High-level**: Computer vision (object detection, AI/ML)

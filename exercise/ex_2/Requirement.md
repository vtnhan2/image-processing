## Exercise requirement 2

The implementation can be done in **MATLAB** or **Python**.

1. Generate a sinusoidal signal **x1** with frequency 2 kHz and another signal **x2** with frequency 10 kHz, using a sampling frequency of 40 kHz. The sampling duration is 10 seconds.

2. Create the combined signal:  
   \[
   x = x1 + x2
   \]

3. Design and apply an FIR filter to remove **x1** from the combined signal **x**. Provide the filter coefficients and cutoff frequency.

4. Design and apply an FIR filter to remove **x2** from the combined signal **x**. Provide the filter coefficients and cutoff frequency.
